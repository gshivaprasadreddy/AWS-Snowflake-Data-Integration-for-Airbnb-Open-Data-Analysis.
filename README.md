# AWS-Snowflake-Data-Integration-for-Airbnb-Open-Data-Analysis.

Data Preparation:
Performed data cleaning and transformation using Pandas on the Airbnb Open Data to ensure it was properly formatted and prepared for downstream analysis.

Data Storage:
Utilized AWS CLI to upload the cleansed data into an AWS S3 bucket, ensuring secure and scalable cloud storage.

Snowflake  Tables:
Created Snowflake  tables to access data directly from the S3 bucket, optimizing both storage and performance by avoiding data duplication.

Real-Time Data Ingestion:
Designed and implemented Snowpipe to enable continuous data ingestion from AWS S3 to Snowflake, ensuring real-time data availability for analysis.

Data Analysis:
Developed SQL scripts in Snowflake to analyze the Airbnb data, extracting meaningful insights on various aspects such as pricing trends, occupancy rates, and customer preferences.

Data Visualization:
Visualized the processed data using analytical dashboards, enabling data-driven decision-making and real-time reporting.
